# Checkout Order Total Kata

Implements a modular, TDD-driven grocery checkout system in TypeScript.

## Setup

```sh
npm install
```

## Run Tests

```sh
npm test

## Project Structure

- `src/` — business logic
- `tests/` — all tests

## TDD Workflow

Each feature is developed in three commits: failing test, minimal implementation, and refactor.
